# ICLRNN for Fast and Robust Engineering Tasks
**Library for code execution: Tensorflow Keras, Pyipopt, Numpy, sklearn** </br>

File description:
* docker.pptx includes the instruction on how to install Pyipopt into Docker on your laptop. </br>
* Codes for MNIST experiments are available in MNIST folder. </br>
* Codes for Solar PV system experiments are available in SolarPV folder. Due to the confidentiality, the data is not uploaded for public usgae. However, you may view the results in ipynb notebook. <\br>
* Codes for MPC experiments are available in MPC folder. There are two subfolders. Codes in CSTR subfolder are used to model the system dynamics. Codes in MPC subfolder are used to study the performance of neural networks in NN-based MPC optimization. 

FYI:
* .ipynb files can be run on Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.
* Pyipopt can be installed and run on Docker. Codes in MPC subfolder use Pyipopt.
