### File description:
* In the CSTR Modeling folder, we present a Continuous Stirred Tank Reactor (CSTR) example to demonstrate and compare the performance of various neural network architectures on modeling systems governed by Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs). These include conventional Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTMs), Lipschitz Recurrent Neural Networks (LRNNs), Input Convex Recurrent Neural Networks (ICRNNs), and our proposed Input Convex Lipschitz Recurrent Neural Networks (IC-L-RNNs). The evaluation is conducted in the presence of additive Gaussian noise.
